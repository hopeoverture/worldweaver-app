  <div style={{ backgroundColor: cardType.color }}>
    {getIconComponent(cardType.icon, 'large')}
  </div>
  <div className="flex-1 min-w-0">
    <h3>{cardType.name}</h3>
    <p className="line-clamp-2">{cardType.description}</p>
    <span>{cardType.schema?.length || 0} fields</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Rich Metadata Display:**
- Field count from schema
- Card count from usage statistics
- Color-coded type indicators
- Truncated descriptions with line-clamp
