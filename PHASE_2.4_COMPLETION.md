## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```typescript
src/components/cards/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create-card-modal.tsx     # Card creation form
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ edit-card-modal.tsx       # Card editing form  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ card-grid-item.tsx        # Individual card display
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bulk-actions-modal.tsx    # Bulk operations modal
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                  # Barrel exports
```

### Service Layer Integration
```typescript
// Utilizes existing cardService from supabaseService
export const cardService = {
  getCards: (worldId: string, params?: SearchParams) => Promise<PaginatedResponse<Card>>,
  getCard: (cardId: string) => Promise<Card | null>,
  createCard: (card: CreateCardData) => Promise<Card>,
